# Redox OS coreutils

**DEPRECATED**: This repo is being superseded by [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils). Programs here that don't have counterparts in uutils should be moved to [extrautils](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/dahc/extrautils).

This repository contains the core UNIX utilities for Redox OS. These are based on BSD coreutils rather than GNU coreutils as these tools should be as minimal as possible.

**Currently included:**

- ~~`cat`~~

- `clear`
- ~~`dd`~~
- `df`
- `du`
- ~~`env`~~
- `free`
